# Tea Product Optimization through Conjoint Analysis

## Summary
Conducted a conjoint analysis to determine the optimal product composition and pricing for a tea product with dimensions such as kind, variety, and aroma. Reduced the experimental design from 54 conjoint cards to 13 using statistical techniques to minimize participant fatigue while still maintaining high-quality data. Analyzed the pre-given dataset using regression analysis and determined the optimal combination of product dimensions and pricing that maximizes revenue.
